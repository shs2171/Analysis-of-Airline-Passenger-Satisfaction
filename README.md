Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction
Overview
This repository contains all the files related to my project on predicting airline passenger satisfaction. The project utilizes a Kaggle dataset and applies various machine learning techniques to identify factors that lead to passenger dissatisfaction.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to help airlines improve their customer service by predicting which aspects of the flight experience are most likely to lead to dissatisfaction, thus enabling targeted improvements.
