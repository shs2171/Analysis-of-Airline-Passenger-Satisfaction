# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction
Overview
This repository contains all the files related to my project on predicting airline passenger satisfaction. The project utilizes a Kaggle dataset and applies various machine learning techniques to identify factors that lead to passenger dissatisfaction.

# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to help airlines improve their customer service by predicting which aspects of the flight experience are most likely to lead to dissatisfaction, thus enabling targeted improvements.

# Files and Folders
data/: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with all the exploratory data analysis and models.

# Technologies Used
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis
Machine Learning Modeling
Model Evaluation and Selection
Hyperparameter Tuning

# How to Run
Clone this repo to your computer.
Install the necessary libraries mentioned in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebooks within the notebooks/ folder.
Results
The project successfully identified key factors influencing passenger satisfaction and developed predictive models with high accuracy. The final model achieved an accuracy of X% and was particularly good at identifying dissatisfied passengers.
